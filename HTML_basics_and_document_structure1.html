        <blockquote cite="https://www.nps.gov/frdo/learn/historyculture/frederickdouglass.htm"><h2>Frederick Douglass</h2>In his journey from enslaved young man to internationally renowned activist, Frederick Douglass (1818-1895) has been a source of inspiration and hope for millions. His brilliant words and brave actions continue to shape the ways that we think about race, democracy, and the meaning of freedom.
            <br><br>He became the most important leader of the movement for African American civil rights in the 19th century. After escaping from slavery in Maryland, Douglass became a national leader of the abolitionist movement in Massachusetts and New York, during which he gained fame for his oratory and incisive antislavery writings. He wrote three autobiographies, describing his experiences as an enslaved person in his first, Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave (1845), which became a bestseller and was influential in promoting the cause of abolition. 
            <br><br>He also actively supported women's suffrage, and he held several public offices. Without his knowledge or consent, he became the first African American nominated for vice president of the United States, as the running mate of Victoria Woodhull on the Equal Rights Party ticket. He believed in dialogue and in making alliances across racial and ideological divides. 
            <br><br>Frederick Douglass is the Father of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States.
